## 🌟 About Me  

I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology — whether it’s building full-stack applications, exploring AI/ML, or wiring up hardware on a Raspberry Pi rover. I thrive in **hands-on projects** where I can problem-solve, iterate, and deliver something real.  

- **Current Interests:** Machine Learning, AR/VR, robotics, full-stack development  
- **Strengths:** Problem solving, adaptability, and picking up new tools quickly  
- **Goal:** Land research/internship opportunities to grow my technical & collaborative skills
